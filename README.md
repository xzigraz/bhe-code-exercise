# Staff Services Software Engineer Coding Exercise

## The Sieve of Eratosthenes

Prime numbers have many modern day applications and a long history in mathematics. Utilizing your own resources research the sieve of Eratosthenes, an algorithm for generating prime numbers. Based on your research, implement an API in `pkg/sieve/sieve.go` that allows the caller to retrieve the Nth prime number.
Some stub code and a test suite have been provided as a convenience, however, you are encouraged to deviate from Eratosthenes's algorithm, modify the existing functions/methods or anything else that might showcase your ability provided the following requirements are satisfied. 

### Requirements

- A url to a publically accessible `git` repository (GitHub, GitLab, self-hosted, etc) of the completed exercise must be given to your coordinator at least 24 hours in advance of the technical interview
- Interviewers must be able to clone the repository via `git clone` 
- Interviewers must be able to execute a suite of tests via `go test ./...`
- The go library package provides an API for retrieving the Nth prime number using 0-based indexing where the 0th prime number is 2

### Considerations

During the technical interview, your submission will be discussed and you will be evaluated in the following areas:

- Technical ability
- Communication skills
- Work habits and complementary skills
